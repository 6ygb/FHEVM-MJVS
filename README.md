# FHEVM MJVS
This repository showcases a proof of concept (POC) of a Confidential Majority Judgement Voting System (see [wikepedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Majority_judgment) page) deployed on-chain using Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE), powered by Zama‚Äôs [FHEVM](https://github.com/zama-ai/fhevm) framework.

<br />

‚ö†Ô∏è **Note:** This is a technical POC intended to demonstrate the feasibility of privacy-preserving voting on blockchain. Not production-ready.

## üîç How the Voting System Works

### ‚û§ üó≥Ô∏è Voting Flow (Step by Step)

1. **Vote preparation:**
   - Each voter selects a grade **for each candidate** using the **Majority Judgement scale**:
     - Awful, Very Bad, Bad, Medium, Good, Very Good, Excellent.
   - Grades are encoded as **one-hot bit values** in a 7-bit integer:
     - Example: Medium = `0001000` ‚Üí decimal `8`.
   - The grade is then **encrypted locally using the FHEVM SDK**, producing an encrypted value `euint8`, along with a **Zama Gateway proof** to confirm correct encryption.

2. **On-chain vote submission:**
   - The voter submits:
     - Its vote as an array of bit (for example `0001000`, so an encrypted 8)
     - A cryptographic proof (`inputProof`) validated by the Zama Gateway.
   - Example from the test:
     ```typescript
     await this.voteContract.vote([encryptedVote.handles[0], encryptedVote.handles[1]], encryptedVote.inputProof,);
     ```

3. **On-chain vote aggregation:**
   - The smart contract processes the encrypted grades using FHE arithmetic.
   - It splits the encrypted 7-bit vote into 7 encrypted counters (one for each grade). Following our example we will have 0 VGood, 0 Good ... 1 Medium .., 0 VBad; these numbers will be added to the total vote count. As those are encrypted numbers, no one can tell if a 1 or a 0 is added to the vote count.
   - Each candidate has **encrypted counters** like:
     - `candidateScore[candidateId].Excellent`, `candidateScore[candidateId].Medium`, etc.
   - Votes are **added homomorphically**:
     ```solidity
     candidateScore[candidateId].Medium = FHE.add(candidateScore[candidateId].Medium, gradeArray[3]);
     ```
   - No one, including the contract owner, can decrypt these counters at this stage.

4. **Decryption of aggregate results:**
   - When voting ends, the contract owner requests the decryption of **the total votes for each grade of a candidate**.
   - This triggers a call to the **Zama Gateway**, which securely decrypts the encrypted counters and calls the contract back with the clear text results.

5. **Public results:**
   - After decryption, the contract stores the total number of votes for each grade **for each candidate**, which is publicly visible.
   - Example:
     - Candidate 1:
       - Excellent: 5
       - Very Good: 12
       - Medium: 8
       - etc.

<br />


### üîê **Key Confidentiality Principle**

‚û°Ô∏è **Individual votes are never decrypted.**

‚úÖ Only the **aggregated total per grade per candidate** is decrypted.  
‚úÖ No one can know who voted for what grade.  
‚úÖ Even if you vote ‚ÄúVery Good‚Äù for a candidate, only the **total number of ‚ÄúVery Good‚Äù votes** is revealed in the end.

<br />
<br />

## üîë Key Features

- **Confidential Voting:** Votes are encrypted end-to-end using FHE. Votes remain confidential even on-chain.
- **Majority Judgement Mechanism:** Each candidate's score is evaluated on a 7-grade scale (from Awful to Excellent).
- **Secure Decryption:** Encrypted tallies are decrypted securely using Zama‚Äôs Gateway service, and results are transparently published.
- **On-chain Vote Aggregation:** All vote processing, tallying, and storage happens on-chain using encrypted data types (`euint32`, `euint8`).
- **Built with Solidity 0.8.24** and **Zama's FHEVM libraries**.

## üèÜ How is the winner determined?

---

### ‚û§ **Step 1: Aggregate all votes per candidate**

For each candidate, you have the decrypted total number of votes for each grade:

| Grade      | Votes |
|------------|-------|
| Excellent  |   5   |
| Very Good  |   7   |
| Good       |  10   |
| Medium     |   8   |
| Bad        |   2   |
| Very Bad   |   1   |
| Awful      |   1   |

The sum of all these numbers gives the total number of votes cast for that candidate.


### ‚û§ **Step 2: Compute the median grade**

1. **List all grades ordered from best to worst:**

   \`Excellent > Very Good > Good > Medium > Bad > Very Bad > Awful\`

2. Start adding the number of votes from the best grade down.
3. The **grade where you cross the halfway point of total votes** is the **median grade** of the candidate.

**Example:**  
Total votes = 5 + 7 + 10 + 8 + 2 + 1 + 1 = 34  
Half of 34 is 17.

- Excellent: 5 ‚Üí cumulative total = 5
- Very Good: 7 ‚Üí cumulative total = 12
- Good: 10 ‚Üí cumulative total = 22 ‚Üí the median is crossed here.

‚úÖ Median grade for this candidate is **Good**.


### ‚û§ **Step 3: Compare candidates**

- The **candidate with the best median grade wins**.
   - Example: Candidate A has a median of Good, Candidate B has a median of Very Good ‚Üí Candidate B wins.
- If two candidates have the same median grade, the tie-breaker is:
   - Compare the **number of votes** in that median grade and better ones.
   - If still tied, follow Majority Judgement tie-break rules (compare vote profiles in detail).

<br />
<br />


## ‚úÖ Why is this better than "highest total votes"?

- **Majority Judgement** measures the **quality of support**, not just the quantity.
- A candidate with many "Medium" votes but few negative ones may beat a polarizing candidate with many "Excellent" and "Awful" votes.
- This helps elect the **most broadly appreciated** candidate, not necessarily the most divisive.

- `vote(externalEuint8[] calldata encryptedUserVote, bytes calldata inputProof) public ensureVotingOpen`: Submit encrypted votes for candidates.
- `requestResult(uint256 candidateId) public onlyOwner`: Request decryption of a candidate's final score (owner-only).
- `resultCallback(...)`: Called by the Gateway to set the clear-text result on-chain.
- Grades tracked:
  - Excellent
